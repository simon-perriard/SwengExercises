# TDD Part 3


Unfortunately, your shop went bankrupt. But you got noticed for your developer skills and were hired in a big company. As your first first task, you are required to help one of your colleagues on her project. As a developer who didn't follow the SwEng class, she didn't write any tests, as she considers them a waste of time.

You are given multiple classes. Write tests to improve the coverage of the project to at least 90%. 

To check the coverage of your test suite, we recommend that you use Intellij/Android Studio and follow [these instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/generating-code-coverage-report.html).
