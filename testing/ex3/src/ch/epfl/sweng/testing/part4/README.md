# TDD Part 4

Seeing your testing capabilities, a colleague comes by and asks for your assistance. He is required to achieve 100% line coverage on a project, but no matter how many tests he adds, he can't manage to reach that level of coverage.

His project involves simulating entities in an environment, which consists (among others) of pandas and bamboos.

You are given the relevant classes. Write tests based on the comments describing what the methods do. **Do not modify** the code. Can you reach 100% line coverage? If not, can you fix the code to reach it ?
